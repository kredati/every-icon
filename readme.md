## An implementation of John Simon's *Every Icon*
A mockup of John Simon's 1997 net.art piece, *[Every Icon](http://www.numeral.com/appletsoftware/eicon.html)*, written in Javascript and using p5.js. This is only a mockup: it does not include the text (which is important to the piece), and the dates are calculated only using Javascript's built in Date object and plain integers (maximum is 2^53 - 1), which does not get you to the end of the grid. This version will run only until only  the year 33,600 or so.

### Timing is Everything
For reasons I haven't been able to figure out, the timing here doesn't line up with Simon's version, nor, quite, with Patrick LeMieux's *Every Icon Editor*.
